skeleton code
- build payload
- python code to sent to ubidots

look at sample codes
- put into slides and explain
- look for more sample files (pi sent to ubidots)

test the Python script 
VARIABLE_LABEL_1 = "temperature"  # Put your first variable label here
VARIABLE_LABEL_2 = "humidity"  # Put your second variable label here
VARIABLE_LABEL_3 = "position"  # Put your second variable label here
- rename the variables

 while status >= 400 and attempts <= 5:
        req = requests.post(url=url, headers=headers, json=payload)
        status = req.status_code
        attempts += 1
        time.sleep(1)

- rename url to industial
