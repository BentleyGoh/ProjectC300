- build fire and gas sensor for residential properties
- recording readings of fire and gas
- what kind of readings for fire will be considered normal
- gas has the different reading (find the proper threshold)
- raspberry pi 4 and sensor (integrate them)
- find the programming language to use (java, python)
- start simple (able to connect them), and improve them
- collect readings, have to be stored into the cloud (depending on programming language)
- find the cloud suitable
- do the research
